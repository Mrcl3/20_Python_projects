# Python 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the Python 100 Days of Code Challenge! This repository contains my progress and projects as I work through the 100 days of code challenge. 

## About the Challenge

The Python 100 Days of Code Challenge is a popular challenge designed to help developers improve their skills and knowledge of Python. The challenge involves coding for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days, and sharing your progress with the coding community.

## My Progress

I will be updating this repository regularly with my progress as I work through the challenge. Only the last 20 projects will be summarized in this repository, as they contain meaningful code.

## Projects

As part of the 100 days of code challenge, I will be working on a variety of projects to help me practice and develop my Python skills. Each project will be located in its own directory within the 'projects' folder. 

Here is a list of the projects I have completed so far:

- Project 1: analysis of the launch data
