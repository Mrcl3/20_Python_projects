# Morse converter

This is a simple PyQt5 application that converts text to Morse code and vice versa. The application has a GUI with an input field for text and an output field for the Morse code conversion. The Morse code dictionary used for the conversion is defined within the script.

In addition, a toggle button has been added to switch between converting normal text to Morse code and converting Morse code to normal text.

To run the application, ensure that PyQt5 is installed and run the script. The GUI will appear, allowing you to input text and see the corresponding Morse code output. Clicking the toggle button will switch the conversion mode.
