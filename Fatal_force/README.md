# Data Science Task: Analyzing Police Killings in the United States

## Introduction

Police brutality and excessive use of force by law enforcement officials have been longstanding issues in the United States. In recent years, the issue has come to the forefront of national conversation with the rise of social media and citizen journalism. One major source of information on police killings in the US comes from the Washington Post's database, which has been tracking police shootings since 2015. 

## The Washington Post's Database

The Washington Post has been tracking more than a dozen details about each killing, including the race, age, and gender of the deceased, whether the person was armed, and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis. The Post has gathered this supplemental information from law enforcement websites, local new reports, social media, and by monitoring independent databases such as "Killed by police" and "Fatal Encounters". The Post has also conducted additional reporting in many cases. 

## Objective

The objective of this data science task is to analyze the Washington Post's database to gain insights into police killings in the United States. By analyzing the data, we can identify trends and patterns that can help inform policy decisions and raise awareness about the issue. 

## Data Analysis

To analyze the data, we will use Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. We will perform exploratory data analysis to visualize the data and identify trends. We will also use statistical techniques to analyze the data and test hypotheses. 

## Conclusion

Analyzing the Washington Post's database of police killings is an important step in understanding the issue of police brutality in the United States. By gaining insights into the data, we can identify areas for improvement and raise awareness about the issue. Through this data science task, we hope to contribute to the ongoing conversation about police brutality and work towards creating a more just and equitable society.
